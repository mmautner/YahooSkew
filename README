YahooSkew

A script for grabbing options market data from Yahoo finance 
and deducing the implied volatility by strike from the 
bid/ask data. This can be run on a cron job--but complications 
can arise from not following business hours decay (as opposed 
to calendar hours decay) and not accounting for a given stock's 
non-zero discrete dividends.

Hope this can be of use or inspiration to someone besides myself,
